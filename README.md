# OctopusLWRP

## Main Gameplay
- You play as a poulpe underwater
- Side scroller (low poly 3D)
- Controls :
	- Button to assimilate color of object you are currently (hold to keep color when leaving object, you stay color for a number of seconds after you've let go)
	- Button for action (pick / press button) : simple like in Inside
	- Button for speed boost
- Stealth / puzzle game :
	- Try and not be seen by ennemies
	- While solving puzzles to get to the next section

## Other Gameplay Ideas:
- Fish that is trying to go somewhere but gets scared (! near head when scared) so can't go where it needs to go -> have to hide to let him pass
- Fish activate different things
- Attract fish somewhere by placing a shiny rock that the fish will try and go to (can make fish knock something over to activate something)
- Pick seaweed to open up path
- Underwater volcanos to propulse stuff (place rock on it and it will expell it Somewhere)+
- Oil patches you can't get past, have to herd a cleaner fish towards it
- Surprise and scare a fish so it runs off into a wall (maybe knocks walls down or knocks something over)
- Hammer head shark that only attacks red : Assimilate to red color and go on a grid that can be opened near hammer head and love out of the way before attack). He will open grid for you
- Fish that follow you when you assimilate their color -> more strength to open gate
- Snails of colors that you have to fetch to put in front of buttons (ex : If there is no seaweed for you to change color to go in front of button, pick up snail and put it there. Some slowly move away so you still have to be fast)

## Pros & Cons
1. Advantages / Easy parts :
- Side scroller with not a lot of physics (Poulpe doesn't use gravity put objects will)
- Levels are easier to make once I have made prefabs and tools
2. Hard parts :
- Shader coding for poulpe texture animations : https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-shader-to-dynamically-swap-a-sprites-colors--cms-25129
- Poulpe low poly character + animations (buy or do on blender) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3P7QHfqQJI or http://www.basemeshstore.com/?query=octopus&sort=price_desc
